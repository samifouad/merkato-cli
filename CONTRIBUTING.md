## how to contribute to gild

#### did you find a bug?

* **do not open up a github issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in gild** and instead to refer to the [security policy](https://gild.gg/security) on the website for instructions on how to responsibly disclose your concerns

* **ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on github under [issues](https://github.com/samifouad/gild/issues)

* if you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/samifouad/gild/issues/new). be sure to include a **title, sample code and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and if you can run gild, provide the text output of the command: ```gild check```

#### **did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* open a new github pull request with the patch

* ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* suggest your change in github issue to collect feedback about the change. github issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes, however if you label your idea there is no harm in doing that. ideas are always welcome but not always accepted. simplicity is a valuable feature and every "yes" has a cost in complexity and long-term maintinence, so please keep that in mind if you receive a "no"

#### **do you have questions about the source code?**

* the basic guide to code organization and the github workflow for this repo can be found in the [CODE.md](CODE.md) file

#### **do you want to contribute to the gild documentation?**

* documentation is not yet complete, however there will be a repo on github that will accept contributions. a link to it will be made available here in the future.

gild is a volunteer effort lead by a single unpaid individual. if you want to pitch in and help, you can donate at my [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/samifouad) page.

be well  :heart:
